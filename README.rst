My Hosts File
=============

I store here a hosts file I made for blocking porn on Android even though it can also be used on Windows, and maybe in other OS like Ubuntu or MacOS. I may also fork some other hosts files and keep them here or maybe mix them in a single file.

How-To-Host
-----------------------
.. overview-begin-marker-do-not-remove
- On Android an app like `AdAway
  <https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2190753>`_ or `PornAway
  <https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/root-pornaway-block-porn-sites-t3460036>`_ is needed, adding `this
  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foopsss/hosts/master/hosts-porn>`_ URL as a hosts file source.
  - You may also go with a file browser to "system/etc" and search for the hosts file there and edit it manually, adding the content of the file saved here in your own one.
