My Hosts File
=============

I store here a hosts file I made for blocking porn on Android even though it can also be used on Windows, and maybe in other OS like Ubuntu or MacOS. I may also fork some other hosts files and keep them here or maybe mix them in a single file.

    **A little bit of info: I did this for myself mainly to deal with a slight
    porn addiction, but I realize it can also be useful for someone else
    like a parent trying to avoid its children from watching porn or some
    kind of related stuff, so I decided to upload it here**.

How-To-Host
-----------------------
- On Android an app like `AdAway
  <https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2190753>`_, `PornAway
  <https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/root-pornaway-block-porn-sites-t3460036>`_ or `Blokada
  <https://github.com/blokadaorg/blokada>`_ is needed, and then you have to add `this
  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foopsss/hosts/master/hosts-porn>`_ URL as a hosts file source.
   - You may also go with a file browser to "system/etc" and search for the hosts file there and edit it manually, adding the content of the file saved here in your own one. Do not forget to give the file rw-r-r (644) permissions.
- On Windows, you have to edit the file (located in *c:/Windows/System32/Drivers/etc/hosts*) with Notepad oy any other text editor as an administrator and paste the content of the `"hosts-porn"
  <https://github.com/foopsss/hosts/blob/master/hosts-porn>`_ file there.
   - If you aren't allowed to save the file you may first have to copy it to your desktop and edit it there and then move it back to the *etc* folder.
