    **A little bit of info: I do this for myself mainly to deal with a slight porn addiction, but I realize it could be usefull for other people in the same situation, or maybe parents that don't want their children to see all of these things**.

* On Android an app like `AdAway
  <https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2190753>`_ or `PornAway
  <https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/root-pornaway-block-porn-sites-t3460036>`_ is needed.
