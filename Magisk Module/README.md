# Hosts-Porn Magisk Module

"Hosts-Porn" is a Magisk module that installs a hosts file I've made which blocks over a thousand porn websites and it will not combine with any ad-blocking solutions you may have. To do so, please read up [here](https://github.com/foopsss/hosts/blob/master/README.md#mobile-operative-systems) on how to integrate the file contained on this module as a hosts source into any app like AdAway, PornAway or Blokada.
