# README

I intend to store here a hosts file I made for blocking porn that can be applied on Android apps like AdAway or PornAway. It can also be used on Windows, and maybe in other OS like Ubuntu or MacOS. I may also fork some other hosts files and keep them here or maybe mix them in a single file.

Install instructions are available below.

# How-To-Host

Android
-------
On Android you must have an app like AdAway (https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2190753) or PornAway (https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/root-pornaway-block-porn-sites-t3460036) and add the following URL as a source: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foopsss/hosts/master/hosts-porn".

You may also go with a file browser to "system/etc" and search for the hosts file there and edit it manually, adding the content of the file saved here in your own one.

Windows
