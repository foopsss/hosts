# README

I intend to store here a hosts file I made for blocking porn that can be applied on Android apps like AdAway or PornAway. It could also be used on Windows even though I don't know how to do it. I may also fork some other hosts files and keep them here or maybe mix them in a single file.

Install instructions are available below.

# How-To-Host

Android
-------
On Android you must have an app like AdAway (https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2190753) or PornAway (https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/root-pornaway-block-porn-sites-t3460036). Once you have any of them installed you'll have to click the three dots on the top right corner, then go to "Hosts Sources", after that click the plus (+) sign also on the top right corner and add the following URL: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foopsss/hosts/master/hosts-porn".

You may also go with a file browser to "system/etc" and search for the hosts file there and edit it manually, adding the content of the file saved here in your own one.

Windows
