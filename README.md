# My Hosts File

I store here a hosts file I made for blocking porn sites. It can be used on Windows, Android, Linux and macOS.

    A little bit of info: I did this for myself mainly, to deal with a slight
    porn addiction but I realize it can also be useful for someone else
    like a parent trying to avoid its children from watching porn, so I decided to upload it here.
    
# Installation

## Desktop Operative Systems
For these OSs is recommended to open the already existing file and just add the contents of "hosts-porn" there.
* **Windows**: the file is located in *C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts* and it can be directly opened with Notepad or Wordpad to 
be modified. It can also be opened with the "Execute" function using this command: "*notepad c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts*"
(or "*wordpad c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts*" alternatively).
* **Linux**: the file is located in the */etc/* folder and it can be opened using the built-in Nano text editor through a Terminal session
using the command "*sudo nano /etc/hosts*". 
Please note that it requires root privileges do to it being in the root of the drive.
  * Other text editors can also be used with *sudo -name of the text editor chosen- /etc/hosts*.
* **macOS**: the file is also located in */etc/*, just like Linux and it can be opened with any text editor chosen by the user through a 
Terminal session using "*sudo -name of the text editor chosen- /etc/hosts*".
  * For example, if the user chooses to use the VIM GUI Editor the command would be *sudo vim /etc/hosts*.
  
## Mobile Operative Systems
* **Android**: similarly to the last two OSs, the file is located in *system/etc* and can be modified in a series of ways:
