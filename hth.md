# How-To-Host

Android
-------
On Android you must have an app like AdAway (https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2190753) or PornAway (https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/root-pornaway-block-porn-sites-t3460036/page3). Once you have any of them installed you'll have to click the three dots on the top right corner, then go to "Hosts Sources", after that click the plus (+) sign also on the top right corner and add the following URL: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foopsss/hosts/master/hosts.txt"
You may also go with a file browser to "system/etc" and search for the hosts file there and edit it manually, adding the content of the file saved here in your own one.
