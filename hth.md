On Android you must have an app like AdAway () or PornAway () capable of modifying the hosts file. Once you have any of them installed you'll have to click the three dots on the top right corner, then go to "Hosts Sources", after that click the plus (+) sign also on the top right corner and add the following URL: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foopsss/hosts/master/hosts.txt"
